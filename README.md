# proj4-FSJS-oopGame
 Project 4 for the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program at Treehouse

Extra Credit Customizations:
 - Changed addPhraseToDisplay() method so that each phrase word stays together on one line (text wrapping)
 - Edited gameOver() method to add a reveal of the phrase when player loses and number of wrong letters when player wins
 - Added keyboard functionality (keyboard buttons control on screen buttons) in app.js
 - Style changes in app.js:
     - Changed title from "Phrase Hunter" to "Guess The Phrase"
     - Changed font of title and header (font loaded in head of index.html)
     - Added drop shadow to title and header
     - Added instrictions to initial page
     - Added drop shadows to Start Game and all keyboard buttons
     - Added title to scoreboard
     - Made heart icons in scoreboard bigger

PLEASE NOTE: I got the ideas for the first two customizations (text wrapping and extra Game Over message) from other Treehouse FSJS Techdegree student projects, but I did not even look at their code, I found my own way to implement similar features.
