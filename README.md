# Project 4 - Object Oriented Programming Game
 The fourth project for the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program at Treehouse

Extra Credit Customizations:
 - Changed addPhraseToDisplay() method so that each phrase word stays together on one line (text wrapping)
 - Edited gameOver() method to add a reveal of the phrase when player loses and number of wrong letters when player wins
 - Added keyboard functionality (keyboard buttons control on screen buttons) in app.js
 - Phrase is logged to the console for the cheaters
 - Style changes in app.js:
     - Changed font of title and header
     - Changed title from "Phrase Hunter" to "Guess The Phrase"
     - Added drop shadow to title and header
     - Added instrictions to initial page
     - Added drop shadows to Start Game and all keyboard buttons
     - Added title to scoreboard
     - Made heart icons in scoreboard bigger

PLEASE NOTE: I got the ideas for the first two customizations (text wrapping and extra Game Over message) from other Treehouse FSJS Techdegree student projects, but I did not even look at their code, I found my own way to implement similar features.

Project Description:
In this project, you'll create a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." Youâ€™ll use JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.
